Installation
-----------------------------------------------

	This version of DragonSpires was made with Java. To run it you'll
need a Java Virtual Machine(JVM) on your system. DragonSpires is compatible
with JVMs as far back as Java v1.0.2.

	If you use Windows 95/98/NT and have a version of Internet Explorer
you simply need to unzip the files into the directory of your choice, then
refer to the "Using Internet Explorer to Play DragonSpires" section below.

	If this is not your situation you'll need some other JVM such as
Sun's Java Development Kit(JDK) or Java Runtime Environment(JRE). The JRE
is much smaller in size than the JDK because it is soley for running Java
applications and not developing them, but it doesn't have an appletviewer
so you won't be able to play the game with sound effects. If you get the
JRE be sure to get the English-only version, if you prefer, it will be
about 3 megs less of a download.

	There are versions of the JDK and JRE for MS Windows and versions
of Solaris. As of when this was written there was JDK only for Mac OS, no
JRE, but if you're using Mac OS you can still play.

You can download the JRE/JDK and get more info at: http://java.sun.com


Using Internet Explorer to Play DragonSpires
-----------------------------------------------

	If you have Windows 95/98/NT and Internet Explorer just run
dssetup.exe and follow the directions the program gives you. You can run
this setup program anytime to change your preferences.

Note: If you are concerned about memory issues or have had trouble playing
      when using sound effects, run the setup program and choose not to have
      sound effects. Playing without the sound effects option will make the
      game take up less memory.


Using the JDK to Play DragonSpires
-----------------------------------------------

UNIX/DOS shell (Windows 95/98/NT): 

     java DragonSpiresFrame

   * Or if you want to play with sounds:

     appletviewer dsapplet.html


Note: For the UNIX and Windows 95/98/NT JDK/JRE, the argument to the Java
      interpreter is the name of the class to run, not the name of a file.
      Be sure to capitalize the class name exactly as shown above. 

Mac OS: 

     Drag the DragonSpiresFrame.class file icon onto the Java Runner icon.
     When prompted for command-line arguments, simply press Return or click
     the OK button.


Using the JRE to play DragonSpires
-----------------------------------------------

UNIX/DOS shell (Windows 95/98/NT): 

     jre DragonSpiresFrame


Note: For the UNIX and Windows 95/98/NT JDK/JRE, the argument to the Java
      interpreter is the name of the class to run, not the name of a file.
      Be sure to capitalize the class name exactly as shown above.
